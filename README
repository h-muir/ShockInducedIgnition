README

clear state file and directory structure:

- data/
- ExactSols/
- visualisation/
* full_system.cpp
* dimensional_full_system.cpp
* shockTests.H
* ODEsolver.cpp


data/ is populated with solution data as the simulation runs

visualisation/ is the destination of graphics once files are compiled according to terminal instructions at the end of the simulation

ExactSols/ contains the data of the exact solutions from the Toro tests and other papers. This data was used for the versions of the plots generated in the report.

full_system.cpp is the primary program. Non-dimensionalised version which should be used for full system simulation. The program must be compiled with the header file: shockTests.H
The TestCase object for the main studied problem is called : "ShockTest1"
problem parameters are defined as TestCase objects in the header file. All other simulation parameters can be set in the primary program.
The main() function at the very bottom of both programs is where the user can specify the simulation settings. 

dimensional_full_system.cpp should be used to reproduce the Toro tests - validated against dimensional results. All the Toro tests are defined as TestCase objects in shockTests.H

ODEsolver.cpp is the standalone semi-analytic ODE solver for the explosion tests.
